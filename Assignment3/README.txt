Most of the codes are stolen from nthakurdesai3
Code is contained in: https://github.com/SamSnowKitten/CS4641/tree/master/Assignment3

The code for the experiments is in three Jupyter notebooks located in the code directory:
1. unsupervised_learning_1.ipynb: Clustering without dimensionality reduction (the clustering algorithms applied to two datasets, a total of 4 experiments)
2. unsupervised_learning_2.ipynb: Clustering with dimensionality reduction (PCA/ICA/RP/SelectK applied to the two datasets, followed by clustering)
3. unsupervised_learning_3.ipynb: Classification of one of the datasets used previously using a neural network after applying the dimensionality reduction algorithms

Other files:
load_data.py: helper functions for loading data from csv files

The data directory contains the csv files for the two datasets.
